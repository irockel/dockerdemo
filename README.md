# Docker workshop

Quick & dirty example for a Docker workshop.

**Contents:**

- create Dockerfile
- build Docker image
- Docker hub login
- push image
- start and stop a container with docker-compose

## Dockerfile

## Build Docker image

## Docker hub login

To access our private Docker hub (or registry), a login is required.

If you just want to download images, the 'readonly' user is sufficient, but if
you want to push (upload) the images you have built you have to login with
a user with write access. Use the user 'docker' in this case. Passwords are
provided privately :-)

## Start a container

To start the container using docker-compose, use

    docker-compose up -d

To stop and remove the container use

    docker-compose down
